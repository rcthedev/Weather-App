# Weather-App

Hello!
This is my Weather App

It was created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript and a weather api provided by Open Weather (https://openweathermap.org/).

In this Weather App you will see that you can enter in the name of any City or town around the Globe and it will provide you with Current weather, Current Date, as well as the Hi/lows for that day as well as Weather conditions.
fee l free to try.

I Do have to thank YouTube (https://YouTube.com) and Google search for helping we with research and tutorials on how to create this app.
